# Twimagine

**Twimagine** is a serverless Twitter (X) bot that generates AI-powered images based on user prompts. Users interact by mentioning the bot on Twitter with a text description of the desired image. The bot responds with a payment link, and once the payment is confirmed, Twimagine generates the image and replies to the original tweet with the result.
